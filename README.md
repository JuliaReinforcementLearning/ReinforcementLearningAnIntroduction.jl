This project provides the [Julia](https://www.julialang.org/) code to generate figures in the book
[Reinforcement Learning: An
Introduction(2nd)](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html). One of
our main goals is to help users understand the basic concepts of reinforcement
learning from an engineer's perspective. Once you have grasped how different
components are organized, you're ready to explore a wide variety of modern deep
reinforcement learning algorithms in [ReinforcementLearningZoo.jl](https://github.com/JuliaReinforcementLearning/ReinforcementLearning.jl/tree/master/src/ReinforcementLearningZoo).

## How to use?

If you are new to Julia or reinforcement learning, you can preview the
[notebooks](https://juliareinforcementlearning.org/ReinforcementLearningAnIntroduction.jl/) first. (Credit goes to [Andrea PIERRÉ](https://github.com/kir0ul))

For experienced users with the latest stable Julia properly installed:

1. Clone this project.
1. Start the Julia REPL under the folder you created above.
1. Install [Pluto.jl](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl)
    1. `] add Pluto`
    1. `using Pluto`
    1. `Pluto.run()`
1. Now you can see the Pluto page is opened in your browser. Paste
   `notebooks/Chapter01_Tic_Tac_Toe.jl` (or any other file under the `notebooks` folder) into
   the input box and click the `Open` button.
